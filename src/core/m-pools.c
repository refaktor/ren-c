//
// A point of Rebol's design was to remain small and solve its domain without
// relying on a lot of abstraction.  Its memory-management was thus focused on
// staying low-level...and being able to do efficient and lightweight
// allocations of series.
//
// Unless they've been explicitly marked as fixed-size, series have a dynamic
// component.  But they also have a fixed-size component that is allocated
// from a memory pool of other fixed-size things.  This is called the "Node"
// in both Rebol and Red terminology.  It is an item whose pointer is valid
// for the lifetime of the object, regardless of resizing.  This is where
// header information is stored, and pointers to these objects may be saved
// in REBVAL values; such that they are kept alive by the garbage collector.
//
// The more complicated thing to do memory pooling of is the variable-sized
// portion of a series (currently called the "series data")...as series sizes
// can vary widely.  But a trick Rebol has is that a series might be able to
// take advantage of being given back an allocation larger than requested.
// They can use it as reserved space for growth.
//
// (Typical models for implementation of things like C++'s std::vector do not
// reach below new[] or delete[]...which are generally implemented with malloc
// and free under the hood.  Their buffered additional capacity is done
// assuming the allocation they get is as big as they asked for...no more and
// no less.)
//
// !!! While the space usage is very optimized in this model, there was no
// consideration for intelligent thread safety for allocations and frees.
// So although code like `tcmalloc` might be slower and have more overhead,
// it does offer that advantage.
//
// R3-Alpha included some code to assist in debugging client code using series
// such as by initializing the memory to garbage values.  Given the existence
// of modern tools like Valgrind and Address Sanitizer, Ren-C instead has a
// mode in which pools are not used for data allocations, but going through
// malloc and free.  You can enable this by setting the environment variable
// R3_ALWAYS_MALLOC to 1.

//
// Alloc_Mem is an interface for a basic memory allocator.  It is coupled with
// a Free_Mem function that clients must call with the correct size of the
// memory block to be freed.  It is thus lower-level than malloc()... whose
// where clients do not need to remember the size of the allocation to pass
// into free().
//
// One motivation behind using such an allocator in Rebol is to allow it to
// keep knowledge of how much memory the system is using.  This means it can
// decide when to trigger a garbage collection, or raise an out-of-memory error
// before the operating system would, e.g. via 'ulimit':
//
//     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1229241/
//
// Finer-grained allocations are done with memory pooling.  But the blocks of
// memory used by the pools are still acquired using ALLOC_N and FREE_N, which
// are interfaces to this routine.

    // current implementations on all C platforms just pass through to
    // malloc and free.

#ifdef NDEBUG

#else
    // In debug builds we cache the size at the head of the allocation
    // so we can check it.  This also allows us to catch cases when
    // free() is paired with Alloc_Mem() instead of using Free_Mem()
    //

    // to remain suitable in alignment for 64-bit values!

//
// NOTE: Instead of Free_Mem, use the FREE and FREE_N wrapper macros to ensure

//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Free_Mem is a wrapper over free(), that subtracts from a total count that
// Rebol can see how much memory was released.  This information assists in
// deciding when it is necessary to run a garbage collection, or when to
// impose a quota.
//
// Release builds have no way to check that the correct size is passed in
// for the allocated unit.  But in debug builds the size is stored with the
// allocation and checked here.  Also, the pointer is skewed such that if
// clients try to use a normal free() and bypass Free_Mem it will trigger
// debug alerts from the C runtime of trying to free a non-head-of-malloc.
//
// We also know the host allocator (OS_Alloc_Mem) uses a similar trick.  But
// since it doesn't require callers to remember the size, it puts a known
// garbage value for this routine to check for--to give a useful message.
